# Spijet's overlay
(I still need to figure out a cool name)

This is a Gentoo repo (overlay if you like it) where I'll try to maintain some stuff that I use daily (and miss having nice and updated on Arch).

## Package List:
 * `app-crypt/keybase-bin`: Keybase desktop app (based on Electron, Debian release package);
 * `app-laptop/battery-stats`: A set of scripts to monitor battery charge;
 * `gnome-base/gnome-extra-apps`: Drop-in replacement for Gentoo's "GNOME Extra Apps" package, to get rid of unneeded dependencies;
 * `media-fonts/tewi`: My favourite bitmap font;
 * `net-im/skypeforlinux`: Skype for Linux Beta (based on Electron and must die);
 * `sys-apps/systemd-swap`: Swapspace setup service for Systemd users;
 * `x11-misc/clipster`: Clipboard manager;
 * `x11-misc/lemonbar`: A lightweight X11 panel/bar;
 * `x11-misc/lightdm`: LightDM package with Vala support;
 * `x11-misc/lightdm-settings`: LightDM settings GUI (for "Slick" greeter);
 * `x11-misc/lightdm-slick-greeter`: LightDM "Slick" Greeter from Linux Mint;
 * `x11-misc/n30f`: A tool to display PNG images in an unmanaged X11 window.
